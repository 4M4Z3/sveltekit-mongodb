## Simple Sveltekit App with MongoDB and TypeScript

#### Features
- Contact with Nodemailer
- Reactive Pagination and Search

The main goal is to use sveltekit, mongodb and typescript technologies in the same project.

URL: https://sveltekit-mongodb-ts.onrender.com 
The site may open slowly because I deployed the project to a free render account.
